Chinese spelling check (CSC) is a task to detect and correct spelling errors in Chinese text. Most state-of-the-art works on the CSC task adopt a BERT-based non-autoregressive language model, which relies on the output independence assumption. The inappropriate independence assumption prevents BERT-based models from learning the dependencies among target tokens, resulting in an incoherent problem. To address the above issue, we propose a novel architecture named Dynamic Connected Networks (DCN), which generates the candidate Chinese characters via a Pinyin Enhanced Candidate Generator and then utilizes an attention-based network to model the dependencies between two adjacent Chinese characters. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on three human-annotated datasets.
